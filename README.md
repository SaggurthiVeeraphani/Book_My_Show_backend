## Assumptions

For the simplicity of system, I have made following assumptions while implementing the solution -

1. Single User Model - One user will use at once. No locking implemented for seat selection.

2. Single Screen Theaters - No multiple screen handling for a theater has been done. However an option is given for future scope.

3. 10 seats for each show are configured - 5 for CLASSIC and 5 for PREMIUM. Seat numbers are kept fixed in all theaters.

4. No Payment flow used.

## API Details

1. UserController - API to add and get user.

2. TicketController - API to book ticket.

3. TheaterController - API to add and get theater.

4. ShowController - API to add show.

5. MovieController - API to add movie.
